## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** CSS, JavaScript, Materialize, Express, EJS, MongoDB

The to-do list project was developed using Express.js, MongoDB, EJS, and CSS. Express.js was used as the web application framework to handle routing and server-side logic. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, was chosen for data storage and retrieval of to-do tasks. EJS (Embedded JavaScript) was utilized as the templating engine to dynamically render HTML views with data from the server. CSS was employed for styling and enhancing the visual appearance of the application. Together, these technologies allowed for the creation of a dynamic and responsive to-do list application where users can add, update, and delete tasks, while data is persisted in the MongoDB database.
